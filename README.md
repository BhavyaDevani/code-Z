Here I have built code-Z , which is an Open-AI and Machine Learning model based application that answers any query related to code written in any programming language. With an elegant user-interface that resembles the ChatGPT app, communication with advanced GPT3 model API, and most importantly, the ability to ask the AI for help regarding JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, giving it code and translating it to another programming language, and much more that can be done using this simple application.
